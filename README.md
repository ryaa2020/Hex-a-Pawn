# Hex-a-Pawn

## Objectives

* Gain experience working with tree data structures of higher than 2 arity (number of children)
* Gain more experience with recursive algorithms
* Implement a basic artificial intelligence algorithm for a two-player zero-sum game


## Description

This project uses trees to play a small chess-like game called Hex-a-Pawn. I built a tree representing
all possible states that the game board can be in. Then I implemented several different players that
consult this tree to make moves as they play Hex-a-Pawn. The players include: a human player that asks
the user for moves to make; a random player that picks possible moves at random; and a computer player
that improves its strategy by learning from past mistakes (but not from past victories). In the end, I ran the different
players against each other.
